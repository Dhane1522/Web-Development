            <a name="Top">
              Preikestolen or Prekestolen (English: 'The Pulpit Rock', 'Pulpit',
              or 'Preacher's Chair') is a tourist attraction in the municipality
              of Strand in Rogaland county, Norway. Preikestolen is a steep
              cliff which rises 604 metres (1,982 ft) above Lysefjorden. Atop
              the cliff, there is an almost flat top of approximately 25 by 25
              metres (82 ft × 82 ft). Preikestolen is located near the Western
              part of the fjord, and on its North side.

              The old local name of the site is Hyvlatonnå; English:
              (woodworker's) Plane's Tooth. The name Prekestolen (without the i)
              was coined around the year 1900 when the local tourist
              organisation, Stavanger Turistforening [no], wanted to promote the
              site for trekking. The "i" was added later to concord with
              Nynorsk, the official local form of Norwegian, and the site is now
              known both locally and officially as "Preikestolen."

              Preikestolen is located in the southern part of the Ryfylke
              district in Rogaland county in Western Norway. The city of
              Stavanger, the fourth largest in Norway, with a number of direct
              flights to/from European cities, is located 25 kilometres (16 mi)
              from the site. The parking facility for Preikestolen is located,
              thanks to the April 2020 opening of underwater tunnel
              Ryfylketunnelen, about 40 minutes from Stavanger by car.

            <h4>Geology</h4>

            <p>
              The cliff was formed during the ice age, approximately 10,000
              years ago, when the edges of the glacier reached the cliff. The
              water from the glacier froze in the crevices of the mountain and
              eventually broke off large, angular blocks, which were later
              carried away with the glacier. This is the cause of the angular
              shape of the plateau. Along the plateau itself there continues to
              be a deep crack. Due to these cracks, the plateau will at some
              point fall down, but all the geological investigations have
              revealed that this will not happen in the foreseeable future, and
              geologists have confirmed the safety of the plateau.

            <p>Along the fjord there is a mild and humid coastal climate.</p>

            <hr />
            <p>
              In early April 2013, a project started to improve the path up to
              Preikestolen as the old one was so small that it often caused
              "delays", and at some points on the path it was sometimes
              impossible to get through. By 2016 the path was completed.
              <br />
              In 2019 a new project started to further improve paths, new
              website and improvement of signs.
